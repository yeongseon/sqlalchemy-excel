# Contributing Guide

We welcome contributions to the `sqlalchemy-excel` project.

## Branch Strategy

Use GitHub Flow and branch from `main`.

Recommended branch prefixes:

- `feat/` for new features
- `fix/` for bug fixes
- `docs/` for documentation-only changes
- `chore/` for tooling and maintenance
- `ci/` for workflow updates

## Development Workflow

1. Create a branch from `main`.
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Write code and tests.
3. Run the local quality gate.
   ```bash
   make check-all
   ```
4. Push and create a pull request.
   ```bash
   git push origin feat/your-feature-name
   ```

## Project Commands

```bash
make format      # Format code with ruff
make lint        # Lint with ruff
make typecheck   # Type check with mypy
make test        # Run tests
make cov         # Run tests with coverage
make check-all   # Run the full local gate
```

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

### Examples

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add Excel dialect type mapping"
git commit -m "fix: handle NULL column types gracefully"
git commit -m "docs: improve ORM usage examples"
git commit -m "refactor: simplify compiler logic"
git commit -m "chore: update dev dependencies"
```

Use imperative present tense and keep the message concise.
